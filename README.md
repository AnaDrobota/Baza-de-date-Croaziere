# Cruise Management Database (MySQL)

This project implements a relational database for managing cruise operations, including ships, cruises, clients, employees, offers, payments, promotions, and suppliers.

The database was designed with a focus on data integrity, clear relationships between entities, and practical SQL queries for reporting and analysis.

## Features
- Relational schema with primary and foreign keys
- Data integrity through constraints and indexes
- Sample data for testing and demonstration
- SQL queries with joins, filters, and aggregations

## Database Structure
The database includes the following main entities:
- Ships (Vas)
- Cruises (Croaziera)
- Clients
- Employees
- Offers
- Payments
- Promotions
- Salaries
- Points of Interest

## Technologies

## How to Run
1. Run `sql/01_schema.sql` to create the database schema
2. Run `sql/02_seed.sql` to insert sample data
3. Run `sql/03_queries.sql` to test example queries

## Purpose
This project was developed as an academic and practical exercise to strengthen skills in:
- Relational database design
- SQL queries and joins
- Data validation and consistency
